My Project/App Title is AppDevelopmentProject1 which is a to do list where users can add, edit, and remove items.
Basic instructions on usage: This app has total of four screens: 
1. launch screen: Users are welcomed with a cute picture of a dog.
2. task list screen: Screen spontaneously moves from launch screen to task list screen where users can add to do items. If user has a list of to do items, all the to do items are shown in this screen.
3. create new task screen: After users click on '+' button on task list screen, screen modally presents text fields, date picker, complete toggle, and description text view where users can add the name of the to do task, due date of the task, status of the task, and description of the task. Users must enter the name of the task, and click on date for saving the task in the list. Users have a choice either to write or not on description.
4. task details screen: When users click on task itself, it shows the details of the task. They can pick a task, change the title of the task, due date, and description. Then, save it.
Any special info we need to run the app: While creating a task, make sure the complete toggle is not green. Green complete toggle means task is complete and no color complete toggle means project is incomplete. In addition, done tasks can be made undone with left to right swipe and right to left swipe deletes the task.
Lessons learned (at least one paragraph)
I followed and completed Apple's tutorial which was very helpful. I forgot to customize some variables according to the requirements and I have some variable names and class file names mostly from Apple's Tutorial. However, I did all the functionalites that was part of the requirements.
